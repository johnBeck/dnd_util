# Utility for DND

I was recently taking a little trip down memory lane and discovered the first CRPG that I can recall playing. I had a great time with this as a kid and it even lead me to accidentally erase my entire computer once (maybe 5 year olds shouldn't be given unfettered access to computers...good thing my dad is religious about backups)!

Anyhow, there's an amazing amount of content in this game and I have nowhere near the time or patience to actually try to get through it the 'right' way, so I decided to just cut the the chase and find out exactly what this game has.

I didn't want to really cheat and grab the source somewhere, so I just reverse-engineered the format based off the available clues.

This is by no means a complete anything, and anyone who would like to flesh this out into a full trainer/util or whatever is welcome to do so.

## Usage:

The driver is dnd_map.rb, and you can invoke it with something like:

```
ruby dnd_map.rb 1
```

The dungeon is selected in dnd_map.rb, and the number is the level that you want to see.
